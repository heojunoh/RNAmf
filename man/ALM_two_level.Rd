\title{find the next point by ALM criterion with two fidelity levels and update the model}
\usage{
ALM_two_level(fit, cost, funcs, n.start, parallel = FALSE, ncore = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{an object of class RNAmf.}

\item{cost}{a vector of the costs for each level of fidelity.}

\item{funcs}{list of functions for each level of fidelity.}

\item{n.start}{a number of candidate point. Default is 10*d.}

\item{parallel}{logical indicating whether to run parallel or not. Default is FALSE.}

\item{ncore}{the number of core for parallel.}
}
\value{
A list containing the integrated one-step ahead variance:
\itemize{
  \item \code{fit}: fitted model after acquire chosen point.
  \item \code{predsig2.low}: vector of predictive variance of optimized data point at level 1.
  \item \code{predsig2}: vector of predictive variance of optimized data point at level 2.
  \item \code{cost}: vector of the costs for each level of fidelity.
  \item \code{Xcand}: candidate data points considered to be acquired.
  \item \code{chosen}: list of chosen level, location, and point.
}
