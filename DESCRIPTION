Title: Multi-fidelity emulation of recursive non-additive model
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Junoh Heo <heojunoh@msu.edu>
Maintainer: Junoh Heo <heojunoh@msu.edu>
Description: Multi-fidelity emulation by incorporating the outputs from previous layer to the input recursively,
    which enables a comprehensive analysis of complex computer codes, capturing functional correlations
    between different fidelity levels and enhancing the modeling and prediction capabilities.
